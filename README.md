# CIFAR-Image-classification-using-CNN

The CIFAR-10 dataset (60,000 32x32 images, 10 classes) was leveraged to build a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras. Convolutional layers, pooling layers, and activation functions facilitated feature extraction and complex pattern recognition. After 10 epochs, the model achieved 52.8 percentage accuracy in image classification. This project demonstrates expertise in deep learning frameworks (CNNs) for image classification tasks and proficiency in data visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn}
